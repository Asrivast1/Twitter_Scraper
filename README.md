# Twitter Keyword Scraper
This Python script is designed to scrape tweets from Twitter based on specific keywords and save them to a CSV file. It uses the Tweepy library for accessing Twitter's API.

## Prerequisites
Before using this script, you need to have Twitter's developer account to obtain the following API keys from Twitter:

* Twitter API Consumer Key (consumer_key)
* Twitter API Consumer Secret Key (consumer_secret)
* Twitter API Access Token (access_token)
* Twitter API Access Token Secret (access_token_secret)
* Make sure to replace the placeholder values in the script with your actual API keys.
